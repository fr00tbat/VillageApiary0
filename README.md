## UX
---
### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

The Village Apiary's target users are:
* People who like honey
* People interested in shopping local
* People from the same area as the Village Apiary

What these users would be looking for:
* A local source of honey in the local area
* Information about the different types of honey stocked by the Village Apiary
* Recommendations for where else to shop local
* Recommendations for honey recipes and more honey and bee information

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use.

As mobile phones are now often the most common computer that the average user has access to, it is important that the website is responsive in it's design.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Information section about the different types of pollen that are in the different honeys


### **Structure** 

The website is single-paged as the content is simple and not extensive. The navigation bar at the top allows for easy navigation. The flow of the web page goes from Home > Values > Types of pollen > social media links. This way of structuring the flow of the site seemed to make the most sese, for introducing the small local company, and then the different types of honey it sells. I have included different images to llustrate teh different sections of the website well. I have styled and positioned the different written sections for a clear and concise feel to the website and the information it gives. 

### **Skeleton**





### **Surface**

I decided that browns and blacks would suit the honey website and would be evocative of the deeper shades that can appear in honey in certain lights. It would be ideal that the user associates the feel of the website with the smooth texture and deep colours of honey. I also tried to include some nice airy nature-focused images in order to better communicate the message of caring about nature and the local ecosystems. I have used a clear white to allow the logo and menu to stand out from the honeycomb hero image used in the header. This allows for a good contrast and a professional look, while maintaining the deeper colour tones associated with honey.

I used both the Google fonts 'Zeyada' and 'Roboto Mono' throughout the website. I thought 'Zeyada' was a simple, approachable font that was slightly relaxed and personal, yet still looked crisp and professional, especially in the black on a white background. 'Roboto Mono' is a nice clear font that capitalizes well, and is good for clearly conveying information and simple reading also.

## **Features**

This is a fully responsive website that is compatable with both desktop and mobile viewing. The page is divided into the four sections. It is possible to jump to each of these setions uing the navbar. A black background seemed like a good choice for a good crisp contrast against white, to break up the webpage. The logo appears in 'Zeyada', while the navigational menu is in capitalized 'Roboto Mono', along with the other headings and for any text that can be immediately noticed/scanned while travellling down the webpage. The paragraohs od text were in normal-cased 'Roboto-Mono'. This is the consistent style maintained throughout the webpage so the overall design fits together. 

### *Navbar*

The navbar appears in the top right hand side of the webpage, on a white background the flows in from the side across the honeycomb background. The honeycomb fits the theme of the apiary and honey bees, and indicates the website's colour-palette from the start.
